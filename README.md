This is the final project in KTH Microdegree, *EP232U - Deep Neural Networks*. 
Here we evaluate a number of different univariate forecasting models in the 
context of traffic flow prediction. For full explanations and code, please 
refer to the Jupyter notebook `TrafficForecasting.ipynb`.


We adapted the code (with some modifications/optimizations) from [time-series-forecasting-with-python](https://github.com/jiwidi/time-series-forecasting-with-python) repo.

## Pre-requisites

* Python >= 3.7
* Python dependencies as specificed in `requirements.txt`, i.e.
`pip install -f requirements.txt`
* Internet connection since we load the dataset from another GitHub repo
